Pong game ported to Nexys4 prototyping board.
Pong was the first game developed by Atari Inc. and it was designed and built by Allan Alcorn. Further information can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong.
The code has been ported by Fabrizio Ferrandi by adapting a SDL based tutorial to the PandA methodology for the integration of low level IP cores written in Verilog.
The original SDL code can be found at http://www.aaroncox.net/tutorials/arcade/PaddleBattle.html.
The artificial intelligence used to control the computer paddle is based on a random function described at http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/smallprng.html
